# Summaries
```
The univariate histograms created above visualize the distribution of two key variables: "distance" and "air_time" from the "nycflights13" dataset. I used ggplot2 to produce these plots,it allowed to easily see the patterns within each variable. It provided a clear representation of how frequently different values or intervals occurred. Notably, for the "distance" variable, the data appeared right-skewed, with a higher frequency of shorter flight distances, while the "air_time" variable showed a relatively symmetric distribution with a peak around a specific airtime duration. These insights gave us a sense of the data's characteristics.

Afterwards, I created a bivariate scatter plot to explore the relationship between these two varibles; "distance" and "air_time." This plot illustrated how airtime changes concerning flight distance. Interestingly, I observed a positive correlation between these variables; as flight distance increased, so did airtime. The use of transparency in the scatter plot allowed me to identify denser regions and perceive concentration trends in the data.
